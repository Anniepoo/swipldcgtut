<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a id='anchintro' ></a></p>

<h3>Who This Course Is For</h3>

<p>This course is for anyone who knows swi-Prolog reasonably well and wants to effectively generate or parse lists. Notice that those two items go far beyond the canonical DCG task of parsing text.</p>

<h3>Getting The Most From This Course</h3>

<p>Besides this web page we offer a series of example programs.</p>

<p>The example programs are <em>not</em> reproduced here. We want you to actually <em>look at</em> and <em>fiddle with</em> the code. So hopefully you'll be encouraged if you have to read it locally. You can get the examples <a href="https://github.com/Anniepoo/swipldcgtut">from github</a></p>

<p>To get the most from this course, you'll need to</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a working <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org">swi-Prolog</a> install </li>
<li>Get the example files from <a href="https://github.com/Anniepoo/swipldcgtut">from github</a></li>
<li>Understand basic Prolog be able to use SWI-Prolog's environment</li>
<li>Read the text</li>
<li>Try each example program.  Experiment!</li>
<li>Do the exercises</li>
</ul>

<p>The example programs are labelled with the chapter and section number, so dcg1_2.pl is the code for chapter one section 2.</p>

<p>Different people will have different backgrounds and learning styles. Whatever works for you works.</p>

<h3>Getting Stuck</h3>

<p>If you have questions and reasonable effort doesn't answer them, drop me email at aogborn (somechar) uh.edu. Please, if you're taking a beginning Prolog course, ask your instructor. Questions about family trees will be ignored. But if you're working on a real DCG related problem, feel free.</p>

<p>Asking on ##Prolog on freenode.net IRC is also a good way to get answers.</p>

<h2>1 Definite Clause Grammars</h2>
<p>A Prolog <em>definite clause grammar</em> (DCG) describes a Prolog list.
Operationally, DCGs can be used to parse and generate lists.</p>
<h3>1_1 DCG rules</h3>
<p>A DCG is defined by <em>DCG rules</em>. A DCG rule has the form: </p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>Head --&gt; Body.
</code></pre></div>
<p>A DCG head with functor f and arity N is referred to as <code>f//N</code> to distinguish it 
from a regular Prolog predicate, which we refer to as <code>f/N</code>.</p>
<p>A rule's head is a Prolog term that is not a variable.</p>
<p>A rule's body is a sequence of terminals and nonterminals, separated by (,)/2 (comma operator).</p>
<p>A terminal is a Prolog list, which stands for the elements it contains.</p>
A nonterminal refers to a DCG rule or other language construct, which stand for the elements 
they themselves describe. Declaratively, we can read the comma as <em>"and then"</em> in DCGs. </p>
<p><img src="syntaxofdcg.png" /></p>
<p>As an example, let us describe lists that only contain the atom 'a'. We shall use the nonterminal <code>as//0</code> to refer to such lists: </p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>   as --&gt; [].
   as --&gt; [a], as.
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first rule says: The empty list is such a list. The second rule says: A list containing the atom 'a' <em>and then</em> only atoms 'a' is also such a list.</p>

<p>To execute a grammar rule, we use Prolog's <code>built-in phrase/2</code> predicate. The first argument is a DCG body. <code>phrase(Body, Ls)</code> is true iff Body describes the list Ls.</p>

<p>The most general query asks for all solutions:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  ?- phrase(as, Ls).
  Ls = [] ;
  Ls = [a] ;
  Ls = [a, a] ;
  Ls = [a, a, a] ;
  Ls = [a, a, a, a] ;
  etc.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Examples of more specific queries and the system's answers:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  ?- phrase(as, [a,a,a]).
  true.

  ?- phrase(as, [b,c,d]).
  false.

  ?- phrase(as, [a,X,a]).
  X = a.
</code></pre></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class='precode exercise'><pre><code>Exercises:
1) run 1_1. Add another DCG that creates an alternating series of a's and b's, so your output should look like:
  Ls = [] ;
  Ls = [a] ;
  Ls = [a, b] ;
  Ls = [a, b, a] ;
  Ls = [a, b, a, b] ;
  etc.
2) Try the queries above in 'examples of more specific queries'
</code></pre></div>
<h3>1_2 More DCG Syntax</h3>
<p>Double quoted strings <code>"some text"</code> are lists of char codes 
(this behavior is changeable in SWI-Prolog). This makes for a convenient syntax with
literals as strings:</p> 
<div class='precode'><pre><code>cliche -->
    thing,
    " is a ", 
    type_of_thing, 
    " trapped in a ", 
    opposite_type_of_thing, 
    " body.".
thing --> "Cygwin".
type_of_thing --> "Unix OS".
opposite_type_of_thing --> "Windows'".

?- phrase(cliche, X, []),format('~s~n', [X]).
Cygwin is a Unix OS trapped in a Windows' body.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Arguments in head and body terms become formal and actual arguments, as in the <code>:-</code> operator.</p>
<p>To execute a regular Prolog predicate from within a DCG body,
we use the DCG language construct <code>{}//1</code>.</p>
<p> This example demonstrates both concepts.</p>
<div class='precode'><pre><code>fizz_buzz(Msg) --> anything, fizz(Msg), anything, buzz, anything.
anything --> [].
anything --> [_], anything.
fizz(Msg) -->
    "fizz",
    {
        format('At fizz we have Msg=~w~n', [Msg])
    }.
buzz -->
    "buzz".
</code></pre></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class='precode exercise'><pre><code>Exercises:
1) Modify the 'cliche' example above to also print 
Fluffy is a dog trapped in a cat's body.
Bob the swimmer is a fish trapped in a human body.
and so on. Hint - use arguments to ensure you don't print
Bob the swimmer is a dog trapped in a Windows' body.

2) Try the queries above in 'examples of more specific queries'
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>;</code> operator allows alternatives. This matches <code>a book</code>, <code>an book</code>, <code>a car</code>, or <code>an car</code></p>
<div class='precode'><pre><code>
article_phrase --> ("a" ; "an"),
	" ",
	noun.

noun --> "book".
noun --> "car".
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>\+</code> operator matches the empty sequence if and only if the material beyond does <em>not</em>
match it's argument</p>
<p>By using the construct <code>\+</code> you are giving up many of the nice
algebraic properties grammars are known for.  In particular, you can
no longer be sure that a grammar generates the sentences it accepts.</p>
<div class='precode'><pre><code>
anything_but_joe --> \+ [joe].
2 ?- listing(anything_but_joe).
anything_but_joe(A, B) :-
        \+ A=[joe|_],
        B=A.
</code></pre></div>
<p>One particularly useful sequence is</p>
<div class='precode'><pre><code>
at_end --> \+ [_].
</code></pre></div>
<p>Which matches the end of the file.</p>
<div class='precode exercise'><pre><code>Exercise:
Implement a demonstration of the at_end nonterm.
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>-></code> operator means 'if followed by', and is semanticly near comma, so is infrequently used</p>
<div class='precode'><pre><code>
ab_or_c --> [a] -> [b]  ; [c].

ab --> [a] -> [b].

6 ?- phrase(ab_or_c, X, []).
X = [a, b].

7 ?- phrase(ab_or_c, [a,b], []).
true.

8 ?- phrase(ab_or_c, [c], []).
true.

9 ?- phrase(ab, [a,b], []).
true.

10 ?- phrase(ab, [c], []).
false.

3 ?- listing(ab).
ab(A, C) :-
        (   A=[a|B]
        ->  B=[b|C]
        ).

true.

4 ?- listing(ab_or_c).
ab_or_c(A, C) :-
        (   A=[a|B]
        ->  B=[b|C]
        ;   A=[c|C]
        ).

true.
</code></pre></div>
<p>One construct where -> can produce clarity is controlling alternatives with <code>{}</code></p>
<div class='precode'><pre><code>
something(X) --> 
      { is_wobbly(X) }  ->
            (  
               "a wobby ",
               thing 
            )
        ;
            (
               "a stable ",
               thing
            ).
</code></pre></div>

<h3>1_3 Capturing Input</h3>
<p>Arguments allow us to capture and use the input list. In this example any digits after
boop must match the digits after beep, so the string must look like <code>"trash beep14 foo blah boop14 mep"</code></p>
<div class='precode'><pre><code>beep_boop --> anything, beep(Suffix), anything, boop(Suffix), anything.

beep(X) -->
    "beep",
    suffix(X).

boop(X) -->
    "boop",
    suffix(X).

suffix([H|T]) -->
      [H],
      {
          code_type(H, digit)
      },
      suffix(T).
suffix([]) --> []. % must be 2nd suffix clause, or the digits wind up in anything
% At bottom for efficiency. At the top, would match beep first
anything --> [].
anything --> [_], anything.
% A subtlety here.  "foo 7 beep1 bar boop14 fdds" is part of the language

</code></pre></div>
<h4>Notation</h4>
<p>A DCG head with functor f and arity N is referred to as <code>f//N</code> to distinguish it 
from a regular Prolog predicate, which we refer to as <code>f/N</code>.</p>
<h4>A Common Gotcha</h4>
<p>A gotcha - matching nothing is</p>
<div class='precode'><pre><code>nothing --> [].
</code></pre></div>
<p>not</p>
<div class='precode'><pre><code>% DONT DO THIS
nothing.
</code></pre></div>
<h3>1_4 Variables in Body</h3>
<p>So what about variables in the body?</p>
<div class='precode'><pre><code>foo(Bar) -->  
      "mep",
      Bar,
      lemons.
</code></pre></div>
<p>They are expanded to the first argument of <code>phrase/3</code>, so 
if Bar in the above is ground to a term it will be treated as a DCG head, and
if bound to a list as a DCG terminal.</p>
<p>TODO find a clear explanation of that</p>
<p>TODO find a good place to mention dcg_basics.pl</p>
<p>TODO lexical issues</p>
<p><a id='anch2' ></a></p>
<h2>2 Relating Trees To Lists</h2>

<p>Let us now use a DCG to relate a binary tree to the in-order sequence of its node names. Let us assume a binary tree consists of leaves of the form <code>nil</code> and inner nodes of the form node(Name, Left, Right), where Left and Right are themselves binary trees. To obtain the in-order sequence of node names, consider:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  tree_nodes(nil) --&gt; [].
  tree_nodes(node(Name, Left, Right)) --&gt;
          tree_nodes(Left),
          [Name],
          tree_nodes(Right).
</code></pre></div>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  ?- phrase(tree_nodes(node(a, node(b, nil,
                                     node(c, nil, nil)),
                               node(d, nil, nil))), Ns).
  Ns = [b, c, a, d].
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can obtain other orders by moving the terminal <code>[Name]</code> in the DCG body.</p>

<p><a id='anch3' ></a></p>
<h2>3 Left Recursion</h2>

<p>Conversely, given a sequence of node names, what are the trees that yield this sequence?:</p>
<p class='warning'>Note: Save your work before running this!</p>
<div class='precode'><pre><code>  ?- phrase(tree_nodes(Tree), [a,b,c,d]).
  Tree = node(a, nil, node(b, nil, node(c, nil, node(d, nil, nil)))) ;
  (... program never finishes ...)
</code></pre></div>

<p>The system yields one (correct) solution, then loops. This is because the grammar is left-recursive: We recursively refer to a nonterminal <code>tree_nodes//1</code> before anything else. To be able to use this grammar for finding all matching trees, we need to encode that for the second rule to apply, at least one list element must be available since the rule contains exactly one terminal, and we need to check this in advance to avoid unbounded recursion. We can do this by introducing two additional arguments that let us limit the number of rule applications to the given list's length:</p>


<div class='precode'><pre><code>  tree_nodes(nil, Ls, Ls) --&gt; [].
  tree_nodes(node(Name, Left, Right), [_|Ls0], Ls) --&gt;
          tree_nodes(Left, Ls0, Ls1),
          [Name],
          tree_nodes(Right, Ls1, Ls).
</code></pre></div>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  ?- Ns = [a,b,c,d], phrase(tree_nodes(Tree, Ns, _), Ns).
  Ns = [a, b, c, d],
  Tree = node(a, nil, node(b, nil, node(c, nil, node(d, nil, nil)))) ;
  Ns = [a, b, c, d],
  Tree = node(a, nil, node(b, nil, node(d, node(c, nil, nil), nil))) ;
  Ns = [a, b, c, d],
  Tree = node(a, nil, node(c, node(b, nil, nil), node(d, nil, nil))) ;
  etc.
</code></pre></div>

<p><a id='anch4' ></a></p>
<h2>4 Right-hand Context Notation</h2>

<p>Using right-hand context notation, also called pushback lists, lets you insert list elements that were
initially not in the list that is being parsed. A DCG rule of the form:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  Head, [T_1,...,T_n] --&gt; Body.
</code></pre></div>

<p>can be read operationally as: parse the list using Body, then prepend the terms T_1, ..., T_n to the
remaining list. For example:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  nt1, [b] --&gt; [a].
  nt2      --&gt; [b].
</code></pre></div>

<p>The body of <code>nt1//0</code> describes a list whose single element is the atom 'a'. Operationally, after <code>nt1//0</code> has consumed the atom 'a' in a list that is being parsed, it inserts the atom 'b' in front of the remaining list. <code>nt2//0</code> describes a list whose single element is the atom 'b'. The following query therefore succeeds, since <code>nt2//0</code> consumes the atom 'b' that is left in the list after <code>nt1//0</code> succeeds:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>   ?- phrase((nt1,nt2), [a]).
   true.
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can also use <code>nt1//0</code> in isolation. However, the following query fails since <code>phrase/2</code> only succeeds if all list elements are consumed by the given DCG body:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  ?- phrase(nt1, [a]).
  false.
</code></pre></div>

<p>The difference list version <code>phrase/3</code> shows what remains after <code>nt1//0</code> succeeds:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  ?- phrase(nt1, [a], Rest).
  Rest = [b].
</code></pre></div>

<p>As expected, the atom 'b' remains in the list.</p>

<p>Using right-hand context notation, we can implement look ahead, which lets us inspect the
next element in the list without removing it. Operationally, we first remove it and then push it back:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  look_ahead(T), [T] --&gt; [T].
</code></pre></div>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  ?- phrase(look_ahead(T), [a], Rest).
  T = a,
  Rest = [a].
</code></pre></div>

<p><a id='anch5' ></a></p>
<h2>5 Implicitly Passing States Around</h2>

<p>Right-hand context notation is also useful to implicitly pass around a state representation 
that is only accessed and changed by a subset of rules. For example, let us count the leaves in a
binary tree with the above presentation. The <em>state</em> we shall pass around is a single number
denoting the number of leaves encountered so far. To increment the state, we use Prolog's
built-in arithmetic.</p>
<p>To execute a regular Prolog predicate from within a DCG body,
we use the DCG language construct <code>{}//1</code>. Operationally,
when the construct <code>{Goal}</code> is executed in a DCG body, Goal is
executed as a regular Prolog goal. Since a DCG must always describe a list, we
wrap the state into a list and thus describe a list containing a single element.</p>
<p>Notice that the second rule makes no reference at all to the state, since the number of
leaves is not modified when an inner node is processed:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  num_leaves(nil), [N1] --&gt; [N0], { N1 is N0 + 1 }.
  num_leaves(node(_,Left,Right)) --&gt;
          num_leaves(Left),
          num_leaves(Right).
</code></pre></div>

<p>Example query, where the initial state is sensibly specified as 0, and the number of leaves is given by the remaining list element after num_leaves//1 succeeds:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  ?- phrase(num_leaves(node(a,node(b,nil,nil),
                              node(c,nil,
                                      node(d,nil,nil)))), [0], [N]).
  N = 5.
</code></pre></div>

<p><a id='anch6' ></a></p>
<h2>6 Parsing From Files</h2>

<p>In SWI-Prolog, DCGs can be transparently applied to files using <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=section%282,%27A.19%27,swi%28%27/doc/Manual/pio.html%27%29%29"><code>library(pio)</code></a>.</p>

<p>Consider for example the following DCG that describes a list of character codes:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>   like(What) --&gt; "I like ", list(What), ".", list(_).

   list([]) --&gt; [].
   list([L|Ls]) --&gt; [L], list(Ls).
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can use this DCG to parse a given string, which is a list of character codes:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  ?- phrase(like(What), "I like it. The rest is ignored").
  What = [105, 116] ;
  false.
</code></pre></div>

<p>As expected, What is unified with the character codes for i and t.</p>

<p>Using <code>library(pio)</code>, we can transparently parse from a file with the same DCG. Assume that the file 'like.txt' starts with the string "I like it."</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  ?- [library(pio)].
  true.

  ?- phrase_from_file(like(What), 'like.txt').
  What = [105, 116] ;
  false.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Again, What is unified with the character codes for <em>i</em> and <em>t</em>. </p>

<p><a id='anch7' ></a></p>
<h2>7 Implementation</h2>

<p>To see how DCGs are internally implemented in SWI-Prolog, you can use <code>listing//1</code>. For example, to see the actual source code for <code>num_leaves//1</code>:</p>

<div class='precode'><pre><code>  ?- listing(num_leaves//1).
  num_leaves(nil, A, D) :-
       A=[B|C],
       E is B+1,
       F=C,
       D=[E|F].
  num_leaves(node(_, A, C), B, E) :-
       num_leaves(A, B, D),
       num_leaves(C, D, E).
</code></pre></div>

<p>We see that internally, the two DCG rules of <code>num_leaves//1</code> were translated into regular Prolog rules with two additional arguments, following mechanical rewriting steps. The translation of DCGs to regular Prolog code is done by <code>term_expansion/2</code>, a mechanism analogous to macros in other languages.</p>

<p>For portability, it is best not to rely on a particular expansion method, and instead to stick to regular DCG constructs like right-hand context notation to refer to states and the <code>phrase/2</code> interface to execute a DCG. </p>

<h2>9 Using DCGs</h2>

<p>Consider using DCGs if you are:</p>

<ul>
<li>describing a list and your code is more complicated than you think it could be.</li>
<li>parsing a list.</li>
<li>reading from a file.</li>
<li>passing around a state representation that only a few predicates actually use or modify.</li>
</ul>
